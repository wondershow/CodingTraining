1. If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot 
extend any other class because Java doesn’t support 
multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable 
interface, our class can still extend other base classes.

2. We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by 
extending Thread class because it provides some 
inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. 
that are not available in Runnable interface.
